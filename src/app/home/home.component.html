    <p>
        This past Summer and this Fall, I've been doing Undergraduate Research at UNCC. My research
        is on the use of fine-tuned large language models for text classification, specifically looking
        at how, for a variety of models, adjustments to the training hyperparamters and dataset affect 
        the confusion matrix generated from their predictions.
